    "Say we want to include two correlated variables as explanatory variables in a regression.  Doing this causes =multicollinearity=, which does not bias coefficients however does increase coefficient standard errors. Note, you can for excessive multicollinearity with variance inflation factors.  To remove the correlation between the variables we can use a process refered to as /orthogonalization/ in the finance literature.  We describe this process in the example below.\n"
